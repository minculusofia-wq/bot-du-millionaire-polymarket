# Bot du Millionnaire - Solana Copy Trading

## Overview

Bot du Millionnaire is an automated Solana copy trading application designed to monitor and replicate trades from selected Solana traders. Its primary purpose is to provide users with real-time portfolio tracking, performance analytics, and configurable trading parameters through an intuitive web interface. The application supports both a TEST mode for simulated trading with virtual capital and a REAL mode for executing actual blockchain transactions. The project aims to empower users to leverage the strategies of successful Solana traders, offering a tool for market participation and potential profit generation.

## Recent Changes (Session Nov 25, 2025)

### UI Enhancements
- ✅ **Nouvel onglet "📊 Positions Ouvertes"**: Onglet dédié pour afficher toutes les positions ouvertes en temps réel
- ✅ **Dashboard solde dynamique**: Affiche $0 sans clé privée, solde réel du wallet quand clé fournie
- ✅ **Benchmark opérationnel**: Endpoint `/api/benchmark` utilise vraies données (PnL traders vs bot)
- ✅ **Tous les traders affichés**: Dashboard affiche les 10 traders du wallet tracker (actifs + inactifs)
- ✅ **PnL complet**: Tous les traders affichent PnL Total, 24h, 7j avec code couleur (vert/rouge)

### Code Quality
- Dashboard positions relocated from Settings to dedicated tab (no code breakage)
- JavaScript parsing fixed: String to numeric conversion for color coding
- API endpoints refactored: benchmark, benchmark_ranking, benchmark_summary now return real data

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is a single-page application built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, embedded within a Flask template. It features a tab-based navigation for Dashboard, Traders, Settings, and History. Real-time updates are achieved through periodic AJAX polling every 2 seconds. The design emphasizes vanilla JavaScript for minimal dependencies, inline CSS for portability, and visual feedback through color-coded indicators and emojis.

### Backend Architecture

The backend is built using Flask, running on Python 3.9+. Key components include:

-   **BotBackend (`bot_logic.py`)**: Manages configuration, trader selection (max 3 active), virtual balances, and validates settings.
-   **Portfolio Tracker (`portfolio_tracker.py`)**: Monitors Solana wallet values, calculates PnL, maintains historical data with 8-day retention, and uses caching (2-minute TTL) to prevent RPC rate limiting. It operates in a background thread.
-   **Copy Trading Simulator (`copy_trading_simulator.py`)**: In TEST mode, it retrieves transactions via Helius API, simulates trades with virtual capital, calculates PnL, and persists data to JSON and SQLite.
-   **Trade Management System**: Includes `Trade Validator` (pre-execution checks with configurable levels), `Trade Safety` (Take Profit/Stop Loss management), and `DEX Handler` (multi-DEX support for Raydium, Orca, Jupiter, Magic Eden).
-   **Monitoring & Logging**: Comprises `Audit Logger` (security-focused logging) and `Performance Monitor` (real-time metrics and alerting).
-   **Blockchain Integration**: Utilizes `Solana Integration` (RPC wrapper, address validation), `Helius Integration` (enhanced transaction parsing for swap detection), and `Solana Executor` (transaction signing/submission for REAL mode).

The architecture follows patterns like "Configuration as Code," a dual storage strategy (JSON for hot data, SQLite for historical), background processing, rate limiting protection, and a security-first design where private keys are in-memory only.

### Data Storage Solutions

-   **JSON Files**: Used for hot data and user-facing configurations such as `config.json` (user settings), `portfolio_tracker.json` (current portfolio state), `simulated_trades.json` (TEST mode history), and `config_tracker.json` (portfolio tracking configuration).
-   **SQLite Database (`bot_data.db`)**: Used for long-term persistence and complex queries. It stores `wallet_history`, `trader_portfolio`, `portfolio_history`, `simulated_trades`, `benchmark_data`, and `audit_logs`. This approach eliminates the need for an external database server.

### Authentication and Authorization

The application is designed for single-user operation. It uses session-based private key storage (in-memory only), where the private key is entered via the web UI for REAL mode and cleared on disconnect/logout. Private keys are never persisted to disk or logged. API keys are managed via environment variables.

## External Dependencies

### Blockchain Services

-   **Solana RPC Endpoints**: Utilizes `https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com` by default for wallet balance queries and transaction retrieval. Configurable via the `RPC_URL` environment variable.
-   **Helius API**: Recommended for enhanced transaction parsing and swap detection. Requires an API key via the `HELIUS_API_KEY` environment variable, with a fallback to standard RPC if unavailable.

### Python Libraries

-   **Required**: `flask` (web framework) and `requests` (HTTP client).
-   **Optional**: `solders`, `solana`, `base58` (graceful degradation if missing).

### External Price Feeds

-   **CoinGecko API**: Implicitly used through RPC metadata for SOL/USD conversion in portfolio valuation.

### DEX Integrations

-   **Jupiter Aggregator**: Planned for swap routing.
-   **Raydium, Orca, Magic Eden**: Protocol-level integrations for token swaps.

The system is designed with minimal dependencies, graceful fallbacks for optional components, and relies on environment variables for API key management. It is deployable on platforms like Replit with minimal configuration.
